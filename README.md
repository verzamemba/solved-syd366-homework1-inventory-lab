 <li>One of Christy’s favourite suppliers has a recall on Shampoo. Something happened in the manufacturing process and dog owners have reported problems.  The supplier is recalling a specific brand manufactured on a specific date.  Fortunately, Christy hasn’t used this shampoo, but she realizes that this is something that she needs to be aware of.  How does your model change?</li>

 <li>Christy’s Mom has been helping Christy with buying supplies. Suddenly, they have more shampoo then they need for the next month.  Turns out that Christy ordered shampoo from Amazon and didn’t realize that the expected delivery date was the following month.  Mom went to Wal-Mart and bought the same amount of shampoo.  What would you do to solve this problem?  How does your model change?</li>

 <li>Christy buys a new hair dryer. She needs to make sure that she never loses the receipt for warranty purposes.  Is the dryer considered to be inventory?  How would your model change to support this requirement?</li>

 <li>What is SKU? Is this important to Christy?</li>

 <li>What is a UPC code? Is this important to Christy?</li>

 <li>What is EOQ? Is this important to Christy?</li>

 <li>What are the types of inventory used in inventory accounting? What types of inventory does Christy have in her trailer?</li>

 <li>Christy finds a sale on Shampoo and would like to buy six months worth of product. How would she use your model to figure out how many bottles to buy?</li>

 <li>The clippers that Christy bought broke and since she purchased them two weeks ago, she can return them. Christy has decided to purchase a different brand of clippers at different store, so she wants to return the broken clippers instead of exchanging them.  Does your model support this?  What changes would you have to make?</li>

 <li>Christy’s trailer was vandalized last night. She has to replace the door to her trailer, her dryers, clippers and her inventory of materials that she’s used to groom dogs.  Her insurance company is covering the costs, but she must provide receipts.  Does your model support this?  How would she access this information?</li>

 <li>Should ingredients be stored in the system as a text string or as a reference attribute to a stand-alone class? What are the benefits or each method?</li>

 <li>Christy had an idea: What about if the system could tell her when she will start to run out of a product? How would your model change to accommodate this?</li>

 <li>Christy currently buys from local retailers and from Amazon. Should she buy from a wholesaler or distributor?  What would be the advantages and disadvantages in doing so?</li>
